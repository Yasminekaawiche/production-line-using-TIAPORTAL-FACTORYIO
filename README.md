PROGRAMS : 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- TIAPORTAL V16
- Factory IO
- PLCSIM

GUIDE : 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To run the simulation, follow these steps:

- Open the TiaPortalV16 program on your computer.
- Once the program is launched, locate and run the simulation. The PLCSim will 
start automatically, simulating the behavior of the programmable logic controller.
- Next, open the Factory IO software. This application provides a virtual environment for simulating industrial processes and equipment.
- Within Factory IO, you will find an interface known as the IHM (Interface Homme Machine) or Human-Machine Interface. Open the IHM to gain control over the simulated factory and its components.
- From the IHM, you can send commands and instructions to control various aspects of the factory's operations, such as activating/deactivating machinery, adjusting settings, or initiating processes.

By following these steps, you will be able to run the simulation and utilize the IHM to command and interact with the virtual factory environment.
